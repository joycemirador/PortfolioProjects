These women served in every service branch, in every combat theater, and in nearly two-thirds of the available military occupations at the time. They were pilots, codebreakers, ordnance experts, gunnery instructors, metalsmiths, chemists, translators, parachute riggers, truck drivers, radarmen, pigeon trainers, and much more. They were directly involved in some of the most important moments of the war, from the D-Day landings to the peace negotiations in Paris. These women--who hailed from every race, creed, and walk of life--died for their country and received the nation's highest honors. Their work, both individually and in total, was at the heart of the Allied strategy that won World War II. Yet, until now, their stories have been relegated to the dusty shelves of military archives or a passing mention in the local paper. Often the women themselves kept their stories private, even from their own families. Now, military analyst Lena Andrews corrects the record with the definitive and comprehensive historical account of American servicewomen during World War II, based on new archival research, firsthand interviews with surviving veterans, and a deep professional understanding of military history and strategy.\",\n          \"A riveting, haunting sequel to the New York Times bestselling thriller Chasing the Boogeyman\\u2014a tale of obsession and the adulation of evil, exploring modern society\\u2019s true-crime obsession with unflinching honesty, sparing no one from the glare of the spotlight.

the Animals, Blackouts mines lost histories--personal and collective.\\n\\nOut in the desert in a place called the Palace, a young man tends to a dying soul, someone he once knew briefly, but who has haunted the edges of his life. Juan Gay--playful raconteur, child lost and found and lost, guardian of the institutionalized--has a project to pass along to this new narrator. It is inspired by a true artifact of a book, Sex Variants: A Study in Homosexual Patterns, which contains stories collected in the early twentieth century from queer subjects by a queer researcher, Jan Gay, whose groundbreaking work was then co-opted by a committee, her name buried. As Juan waits for his end, he and the narrator trade stories--moments of joy and oblivion--and resurrect lost loves, lives, mothers, fathers, minor heroes. The past is with us, beside us, ahead of us; what are we to create from its gaps and erasures?\\n\\nInspired by , , , the book at its own center and the woman who created it, oral histories, and many more texts, images, and influences, Justin Torres's is a work of fiction that sees through the inventions of history and narrative. An extraordinary work of creative imagination, it insists that we look long and steady at the world we have inherited and the world we have made--a world full of ghostly shadows and flashing moments of truth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["genre_list = genres_to_fix['genres'].str.split()\n","genre_list_clean = []\n","for genres in genre_list:\n","  no_comma_list = genres[29:]\n","  no_comma_list = ' '.join(no_comma_list)\n","  genre_list_clean.append(no_comma_list)\n","\n","df.at[18, 'genres'] = genre_list_clean[0]\n","df.at[254, 'genres'] = genre_list_clean[1]\n","df.at[276, 'genres'] = genre_list_clean[2]"],"metadata":{"id":"BcUa9YINALvX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Make a dataframe with no number of votes and no duplicated titles\n","df_no_votes = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'num_of_votes']\n","to_delete = df_no_votes[df_no_votes.duplicated('title')]['title']\n","\n","indices_to_delete = []\n","for title in to_delete:\n","  if title != 'Powerless':\n","    index_to_delete = df_no_votes[df_no_votes['title'] == title].index[1]\n","    df_no_votes.drop(index_to_delete, inplace=True)\n","  else:\n","    pass"],"metadata":{"id":"LNbekryLWIrh","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(f'df_no_votes has {df_no_votes.shape[1]} columns and {df_no_votes.shape[0]} rows')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VWXjC9lYpphf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718512071517,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Joyce Mirador","userId":"13449962648508169744"}},"outputId":"7f15d393-a633-4615-acc8-09c058f1e5cf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["df_no_votes has 14 columns and 284 rows\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# See all the rows of the original dataframe with duplicated titles\n","duplicated_titles = df[df.duplicated('title')]['title']\n","for title in duplicated_titles:\n","  display(df[df['title'] == title])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"1BLuv-9Wszg8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718512072339,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":828,"user":{"displayName":"Joyce Mirador","userId":"13449962648508169744"}},"outputId":"1611fa22-d01c-4a6d-8e43-6b0ecdb19396"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["         title         authors  \\\n","74   Powerless    Elsie Silver   \n","164  Powerless  Lauren Roberts   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","74   Romance, Sports Romance, Contemporary Romance,...    4.09   \n","164  Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, Fantasy Romance...    4.27   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","74           180965          8486           18735           396  English   \n","164          231109         28558           44529           523  English   \n","\n","                                                awards  \\\n","74                     Nominee for Best Romance (2023)   \n","164  Nominee for Best Young Adult Fantasy & Science...   \n","\n","                                  category publication_date  \\\n","74                                 Romance       2023-02-10   \n","164  Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction       2023-01-31   \n","\n","                                    publisher  \\\n","74                                        NaN   \n","164  Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers   \n","\n","                                   isbn  \\\n","74                                  NaN   \n","164  9781665954884 (ISBN10: 1665954884)   \n","\n","                                           description  \n","74   Two childhood friends.

two estranged half-sisters tasked with guarding their family's library of magical books must work together to unravel a deadly secret at the heart of their collection--a tale of familial loyalty and betrayal, and the pursuit of magic and power.\\n\\nFor generations, the Kalotay family has guarded a collection of ancient and rare books. Books that let a person walk through walls or manipulate the elements--books of magic that half-sisters Joanna and Esther have been raised to revere and protect.\\n\\nAll magic comes with a price, though, and for years the sisters have been separated. Esther has fled to a remote base in Antarctica to escape the fate that killed her own mother, and Joanna's isolated herself in their family home in Vermont, devoting her life to the study of these cherished volumes. But after their father dies suddenly while reading a book Joanna has never seen before, the sisters must reunite to preserve their family legacy. In the process, they'll uncover a world of magic far bigger and more dangerous than they ever imagined, and all the secrets their parents kept hidden; secrets that span centuries, continents, and even other libraries . . .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                title        authors  \\\n","9    Pineapple Street  Jenny Jackson   \n","202  Pineapple Street  Jenny Jackson   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","9    Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Literary Fic...    3.57   \n","202  Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Literary Fic...    3.57   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","9            164555         17864           15391           304  English   \n","202          164560         29199           15392           304  English   \n","\n","                                                awards              category  \\\n","9    Nominee for Best Fiction (2023), Nominee for B...

\\u2014Celeste Ng, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Our Missing Hearts\\n\\n\\\"Lively, funny, poignant . . . Prepare to fall in love with Maddie. I did!\\\" \\u2014Bonnie Garmus, #1 New York Times bestselling author of\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s fair to say that Maddie\\u2019s life in London is far from rewarding. With a mother who spends most of her time in Ghana (yet still somehow manages to be overbearing), Maddie is the primary caretaker for her father, who suffers from advanced stage Parkinson\\u2019s. At work, her boss is a nightmare and Maddie is tired of always being the only Black person in every meeting.\\n\\nWhen her mum returns from her latest trip to Ghana, Maddie leaps at the chance to get out of the family home and finally start living. A self-acknowledged late bloomer, she\\u2019s ready to experience some important \\u201cfirsts\\u201d: She finds a flat share, says yes to after-work drinks, pushes for more recognition in her career, and throws herself into the bewildering world of internet dating. But it's not long before tragedy strikes, forcing Maddie to face the true nature of her unconventional family, and the perils\\u2014and rewards\\u2014of putting her heart on the line.\\n\\nSmart, funny, and deeply affecting, Jessica George's deals with the themes of our time with humor and poignancy: from familial duty and racism, to female pleasure, the complexity of love, and the life-saving power of friendship. Most important, it explores what it feels like to be torn between two homes and cultures\\u2015and it celebrates finally being able to find where you belong.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                   title          authors  \\\n","146  The September House  Carissa Orlando   \n","204  The September House  Carissa Orlando   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","146  Horror, Thriller, Fiction, Paranormal, Mystery...    3.92   \n","204  Horror, Thriller, Fiction, Paranormal, Mystery...    3.92   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","146           32482         15783            5641           344  English   \n","204           32482         22346            5641           344  English   \n","\n","                                                awards             category  \\\n","146  Nominee for Best Horror (2023), Nominee for Be...

gladiators fight for their freedom within a depraved private prison system not so far-removed from America's own.\\n\\nLoretta Thurwar and Hamara \\\"Hurricane Staxxx\\\" Stacker are the stars of Chain-Gang All-Stars, the cornerstone of CAPE, or Criminal Action Penal Entertainment, a highly-popular, highly-controversial, profit-raising program in America's increasingly dominant private prison industry. It's the return of the gladiators and prisoners are competing for the ultimate prize: their freedom.\\n\\nIn CAPE, prisoners travel as Links in Chain-Gangs, competing in death-matches for packed arenas with righteous protestors at the gates. Thurwar and Staxxx, both teammates and lovers, are the fan favorites. And if all goes well, Thurwar will be free in just a few matches, a fact she carries as heavily as her lethal hammer. As she prepares to leave her fellow Links, she considers how she might help preserve their humanity, in defiance of these so-called games, but CAPE's corporate owners will stop at nothing to protect their status quo and the obstacles they lay in Thurwar's path have devastating consequences.\\n\\nMoving from the Links in the field to the protestors to the CAPE employees and beyond, is a kaleidoscopic, excoriating look at the American prison system's unholy alliance of systemic racism, unchecked capitalism, and mass incarceration, and a clear-eyed reckoning with what freedom in this country really means.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                               title        authors  \\\n","8    The Collected Regrets of Clover  Mikki Brammer   \n","210  The Collected Regrets of Clover  Mikki Brammer   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","8    Fiction, Contemporary, Romance, Audiobook, Lit...    4.17   \n","210  Fiction, Contemporary, Romance, Audiobook, Lit...    4.17   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","8             64843         18050            9469           314  English   \n","210           64843          6979            9469           314  English   \n","\n","                                                awards              category  \\\n","8    Nominee for Best Fiction (2023), Nominee for B...

someone a beautiful death if you can\\u2019t give yourself a beautiful life?\\n\\nFrom the day she watched her kindergarten teacher drop dead during a dramatic telling of Peter Rabbit , Clover Brooks has felt a stronger connection with the dying than she has with the living. After the beloved grandfather who raised her dies alone while she is traveling, Clover becomes a death doula in New York City, dedicating her life to ushering people peacefully through their end-of-life process.\\n\\nClover spends so much time with the dying that she has no life of her own, until the final wishes of a feisty old woman send Clover on a road trip to uncover a forgotten love story\\u2014and perhaps, her own happy ending. As she finds herself struggling to navigate the uncharted roads of romance and friendship, Clover is forced to examine what she really wants, and whether she\\u2019ll have the courage to go after it.\\n\\nProbing, clever, and hopeful, The Collected Regrets of Clover is perfect for readers of The Midnight Library and Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine as it turns the normally taboo subject of death into a reason to celebrate life.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                    title           authors  \\\n","35   Beyond That, the Sea  Laura Spence-Ash   \n","211  Beyond That, the Sea  Laura Spence-Ash   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","35   Historical Fiction, Fiction, Historical, Roman...    4.25   \n","211  Historical Fiction, Fiction, Historical, Roman...    4.25   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","35            36380          5444            3665           351  English   \n","211           36381          6605            3665           351  English   \n","\n","                                                awards  \\\n","35   Nominee for Best Historical Fiction (2023), No...   \n","211  Nominee for Best Historical Fiction (2023), No...   \n","\n","                            category publication_date      publisher  \\\n","35   Historical Fiction, Debut Novel       2023-03-21  Celadon Books   \n","211  Historical Fiction, Debut Novel       2023-03-21  Celadon Books   \n","\n","                                   isbn  \\\n","35   9781250854377 (ISBN10: 1250854377)   \n","211  9781250854377 (ISBN10: 1250854377)   \n","\n","                                           description  \n","35   A sweeping, tenderhearted love story, Beyond T...  \n","211  A sweeping, tenderhearted love story, Beyond T...

story, Beyond That, the Sea by Laura Spence-Ash tells the story of two families living through World War II on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and the shy, irresistible young woman who will call them both her own.\\n\\nAs German bombs fall over London in 1940, working-class parents Millie and Reginald Thompson make an impossible choice: they decide to send their eleven-year-old daughter, Beatrix, to America. There, she\\u2019ll live with another family for the duration of the war, where they hope she\\u2019ll stay safe.\\n\\nScared and angry, feeling lonely and displaced, Bea arrives in Boston to meet the Gregorys. Mr. and Mrs. G, and their sons William and Gerald, fold Bea seamlessly into their world. She becomes part of this lively family, learning their ways and their stories, adjusting to their affluent lifestyle. Bea grows close to both boys, one older and one younger, and fills in the gap between them. Before long, before she even realizes it, life with the Gregorys feels more natural to her than the quiet, spare life with her own parents back in England.\\n\\nAs Bea comes into herself and relaxes into her new life\\u2014summers on the coast in Maine, new friends clamoring to hear about life across the sea\\u2014the girl she had been begins to fade away, until, abruptly, she is called home to London when the war ends.\\n\\nDesperate as she is not to leave this life behind, Bea dutifully retraces her trip across the Atlantic back to her new, old world. As she returns to post-war London, the memory of her American family stays with her, never fully letting her go, and always pulling on her heart as she tries to move on and pursue love and a life of her own.\\n\\nAs we follow Bea over time, navigating between her two worlds, emerges as a beautifully written, absorbing novel, full of grace and heartache, forgiveness and understanding, loss and love.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                         title       authors  \\\n","11   Shark Heart: A Love Story  Emily Habeck   \n","212  Shark Heart: A Love Story  Emily Habeck   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","11   Fiction, Magical Realism, Fantasy, Romance, Au...    4.01   \n","212  Fiction, Magical Realism, Fantasy, Romance, Au...    4.01   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","11            34916          6218            7509           416  English   \n","212           34918          6041            7509           416  English   \n","\n","                                                awards              category  \\\n","11   Nominee for Best Fiction (2023), Nominee for B...

ending....\\n\\nThe master of the Providence plantation in Barbados gathers his slaves and announces the king has decreed an end to slavery. As of the following day, the Emancipation Act of 1834 will come into effect. The cries of joy fall silent when he announces that they are no longer his slaves; they are now his apprentices. No one can leave. They must work for him for another six years. Freedom is just another name for the life they have always lived. So Rachel runs.\\n\\nAway from Providence, she begins a desperate search to find her children--the five who survived birth and were sold. Are any of them still alive? Rachel has to know. The grueling, dangerous journey takes her from Barbados then, by river, deep into the forest of British Guiana and finally across the sea to Trinidad. She is driven on by the certainty that a mother cannot be truly free without knowing what has become of her children, even if the answer is more than she can bear. These are the stories of Mary Grace, Micah, Thomas Augustus, Cherry Jane and Mercy. But above all this is the story of Rachel and the extraordinary lengths to which a mother will go to find her children...and her freedom.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["           title    authors  \\\n","37   Banyan Moon  Thao Thai   \n","215  Banyan Moon  Thao Thai   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","37   Fiction, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, Lit...    3.92   \n","215  Fiction, Historical Fiction, Contemporary, Lit...    3.92   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","37            23864          3762            2498           336  English   \n","215           23864          3597            2498           336  English   \n","\n","                                                awards  \\\n","37   Nominee for Best Historical Fiction (2023), No...   \n","215  Nominee for Best Historical Fiction (2023), No...   \n","\n","                            category publication_date      publisher  \\\n","37   Historical Fiction, Debut Novel       2023-06-27  Mariner Books   \n","215  Historical Fiction, Debut Novel       2023-06-27  Mariner Books   \n","\n","                                   isbn  \\\n","37   9780063267107 (ISBN10: 0063267101)   \n","215  9780063267107 (ISBN10: 0063267101)   \n","\n","                                           description  \n","37   When Ann Tran gets the call that her fiercely ...  \n","215  When Ann Tran gets the call that her fiercely ...

With both her relationship and carefully planned future now in question, Ann returns home to Florida to face her estranged mother, Hu\\u01a1ng.\\n\\nBack in Florida, Hu\\u01a1ng is simultaneously mourning her mother and resenting her for having the relationship with Ann that she never did. Then Ann and Hu\\u01a1ng learn that Minh has left them both the Banyan House, the crumbling old manor that was Ann\\u2019s childhood home, in all its strange, Gothic glory. Under the same roof for the first time in years, mother and daughter must face the simmering questions of their past and their uncertain futures, while trying to rebuild their relationship without the one person who\\u2019s always held them together.\\n\\nRunning parallel to this is Minh\\u2019s story, as she goes from a lovestruck teenager living in the shadow of the Vietnam War to a determined young mother immigrating to America in search of a better life for her children. And when Ann makes a shocking discovery in the Banyan House\\u2019s attic, long-buried secrets come to light as it becomes clear how decisions Minh made in her youth affected the rest of her life\\u2014and beyond.\\n\\nSpanning decades and continents, from 1960s Vietnam to the wild swamplands of the Florida coast, is a stunning and deeply moving story of mothers and daughters, the things we inherit, and the lives we choose to make out of that inheritance.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["          title                 authors  \\\n","156  Monstrilio  Gerardo Sámano Córdova   \n","216  Monstrilio  Gerardo Sámano Córdova   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","156  Horror, Fiction, Fantasy, Magical Realism, LGB...    4.15   \n","216  Horror, Fiction, Fantasy, Magical Realism, LGB...    4.15   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","156           12314          2595            2723           336  English   \n","216           12314          3391            2723           336  English   \n","\n","                                                awards             category  \\\n","156  Nominee for Best Horror (2023), Nominee for Be...

into a monster, a monster who tries to be a man, and the people who love him in every form he takes\\n\\nGrieving mother Magos cuts out a piece of her deceased eleven-year-old son Santiago\\u2019s lung. Acting on fierce maternal instinct and the dubious logic of an old folktale, she nurtures the lung until it gains sentience, growing into the carnivorous little Monstrilio she keeps hidden within the walls of her family\\u2019s decaying Mexico City estate. Eventually, Monstrilio begins to resemble the Santiago he once was, but his innate impulses\\u2014though curbed by his biological and chosen family\\u2019s communal care\\u2014threaten to destroy this fragile second chance at life.\\n\\nA thought-provoking meditation on grief, acceptance, and the monstrous sides of love and loyalty, Gerardo S\\u00e1mano C\\u00f3rdova blends bold imagination and evocative prose with deep emotional rigor. Told in four acts that span the globe from Brooklyn to Berlin, offers, with uncanny clarity, a cathartic and precise portrait of being human.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["                                title       authors  \\\n","131  I Keep My Exoskeletons to Myself  Marisa Crane   \n","217  I Keep My Exoskeletons to Myself  Marisa Crane   \n","\n","                                                genres  rating  \\\n","131  Fiction, Science Fiction, LGBT, Queer, Dystopi...    3.95   \n","217  Fiction, Science Fiction, LGBT, Queer, Dystopi...    3.95   \n","\n","     num_of_ratings  num_of_votes  num_of_reviews  num_of_pages language  \\\n","131            5438          3739            1060           352  English   \n","217            5438          3165            1060           352  English   \n","\n","                                                awards  \\\n","131  Nominee for Best Science Fiction (2023), Nomin...   \n","217  Nominee for Best Science Fiction (2023), Nomin...   \n","\n","                         category publication_date publisher  \\\n","131  Science Fiction, Debut Novel       2023-01-17  Catapult   \n","217  Science Fiction, Debut Novel       2023-01-17  Catapult   \n","\n","                                   isbn  \\\n","131  9781646221295 (ISBN10: 164622129X)   \n","217  9781646221295 (ISBN10: 164622129X)   \n","\n","                                           description  \n","131  In a United States not so unlike our own, the ...  \n","217  In a United States not so unlike our own, the ...

Within the Department, corruption and prejudice run rampant, giving rise to an underclass of so-called Shadesters who are disenfranchised, publicly shamed, and deprived of civil rights protections.\\n\\nKris is a Shadester and a new mother to a baby born with a second shadow of her own. Grieving the loss of her wife and thoroughly unprepared for the reality of raising a child alone, Kris teeters on the edge of collapse, fumbling in a daze of alcohol, shame, and self-loathing. Yet as the kid grows, Kris finds her footing, raising a child whose irrepressible spark cannot be dampened by the harsh realities of the world.\\n\\nWith a first-person register reminiscent of the fierce self-disclosure of Sheila Heti and the poetic precision of Ocean Vuong, is a bold debut novel that examines the long shadow of grief, the hard work of parenting, and the power of queer resistance.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Upon inspecting the indices of the the duplicates above and checking the\n","# Goodreads website, the number of votes of the row with the lower index\n","# applies to the first award recorded under the awards columns, and vice versa.\n","\n","# Separate the awards and category according to the number of votes\n","for title in duplicated_titles:\n","  if title != 'Powerless':\n","    lower_index = df[df['title'] == title].index.values.astype(int)[0]\n","    higher_index = df[df['title'] == title].index.values.astype(int)[1]\n","\n","    award_list = df.iloc[lower_index]['awards'].split(', ')\n","    category_list = df.iloc[lower_index]['category'].split(', ')\n","\n","    df.at[lower_index, 'awards'] = award_list[0]\n","    df.at[lower_index, 'category'] = category_list[0]\n","\n","    df.at[higher_index, 'awards'] = award_list[1]\n","    df.at[higher_index, 'category'] = category_list[1]\n","  else:\n","    pass"],"metadata":{"id":"m1b1rRVFiS5x"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Save CSV files"],"metadata":{"id":"oirhMhfyVldr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_no_votes.to_csv('goodreads_best_books_2023.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')\n","df.to_csv('goodreads_2023_awards.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')"],"metadata":{"id":"ac-C7T1PVpAY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Split the genres\n","df['genres'] = df['genres'].str.split(', ')\n","df_genre = df.explode('genres').reset_index(drop=True)\n","\n","print(f'df_genre has {df_genre.shape[1]} columns and {df_genre.shape[0]} rows.')\n","df_genre.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":504},"id":"_JH0buoPUoJ1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718512072339,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Joyce Mirador","userId":"13449962648508169744"}},"outputId":"83835c5f-84b7-4ba0-e971-76fbdc8d8df6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["df_genre has 15 columns and 2093 rows.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["        title     authors            genres  rating  num_of_ratings  \\\n","0  Yellowface  R.F.
